# CT-heart-Segmentation

In this project, I used the U-Net architecture with the EfficientNet-B0 encoder and the Dice coefficient as the loss function to segment the heart in CT scans. The model achieved an IoU of about 85% and a Dice coefficient of 92% on the test set,There are some examples of predictions below.
